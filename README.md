# Insight Generated 
1.  🎬A significant majority of Netflix content is movies(86.25%), while shows (especially long-running or episodic series) form only 13.75%.
- Invest in More Original Series.
- Promote regional web series or episodic documentaries to build user stickiness.
2.  🎭Drama (38.96%) and Comedy (23.86%) are the top genres by volume and viewership
- Create regional-language dramas and comedies to cater to local preferences.
- Include interactive or genre-blending formats (e.g., comedy thrillers)

3.  🌍Strong Presence in North America & Europe
- Expand Local Content Creation in Underrepresented Markets.
- Focus on emerging markets in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America.
- Collaborate with local creators to produce culturally relevant stories.

4.  📈 Massive Spike in Content in 2020 due to Covid, Then Drops
- Balance volume with data-backed quality control.
- Use viewership analytics to greenlight sequels/spin-offs of successful titles.

5. 🎥 Low IMDb Ratings for Some Genres (e.g., War, Horror, Action)
- Prioritize Quality over Quantity in Low-Performing Genres.
- Improve scripts, production quality, and actor selection.
- Use audience feedback loops to fine-tune genre-specific content.

6.  🧠 Viewer Engagement Tools Are Underutilized
- Enhance Viewer Engagement
- Introduce interactive content (like Bandersnatch).
- Add gamification, polls, quizzes to boost session duration.
